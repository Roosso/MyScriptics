# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#### 0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

#### 1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

#### 2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

#### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

#### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

#### 7. Additional Terms.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

#### 8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

#### 11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

#### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

#### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

#### 14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

#### 16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

### END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

RooCMS - Open Source free Content Managment System

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

RooCMS Copyright (C) 2010  alex Roosso aka alexandr Belov

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

### ПРЕАМБУЛА

Стандартная Общественная Лицензия GNU (GNU General Public License, GNU GPL) - это свободная copyleft лицензия для программного обеспечения (ПО) и других видов произведений.

Большинство лицензий на программное обеспечение и другие произведения спроектированы так, чтобы лишить вас свободы делиться ими и изменять их. Стандартная Общественная Лицензия GNU, напротив, разработана с целью гарантировать Ваше право распространять и вносить изменения во все версии программного обеспечения - для уверенности, что ПО останется свободным для всех пользователей. Мы, Фонд Свободного Программного Обеспечения (Free Software Foundation), используем GNU GPL для большей части нашего программного обеспечения; эта лицензия применяется также к любым другим произведениям, чьи авторы используют её. Вы можете использовать эту лицензию и для своего ПО.

Когда мы говорим о свободном ПО, мы говорим о свободе, а не цене. Наши лицензии спроектированы так, чтобы удостовериться в Вашем праве распространять копии свободного ПО (и взимать за это плату по своему желанию), чтобы Вы получали исходный код или могли получить его при желании, чтобы Вы могли изменять ПО или использовать его части в новых свободных программах, и чтобы Вы знали что Вы можете это сделать.

Для защиты Ваших прав, нам необходимо ограничивать других в возможности отказать Вам в Ваших правах или просить Вас отказаться от них. Поэтому если Вы распространяете копии свободного ПО или изменяете его, то на Вас ложатся некоторые обязанности: обязанности уважать свободу других.

Например, если Вы распространяете копии свободного ПО, бесплатно или по определённой цене, Вы должны предоставлять получателям те же свободы, которые получили сами. Вы должны быть уверены, что они, также как и Вы, получили или могут получить исходный код. И Вы должны донести до них эти условия, чтобы они знали свои права.

Разработчики, использующие GNU GPL, защищают Ваши права с помощью следующих двух шагов: (1) заявляют авторские права на ПО, и (2) предоставляют Вам эту лицензию, дающую Вам законное право копировать, распространять и/или изменять его.

Для защиты разработчиков и авторов GPL чётко объясняет, что нет никакой гарантии, распространяемой на свободное ПО. Для удобства пользователей и авторов, GPL требует чтобы модифицированные версии обозначались как "изменённые", таким образом проблемы и ошибки изменённых версий не будут ошибочно приписаны авторам оригинала.

Некоторые устройства спроектированы так, чтобы запретить пользователю установку или запуск изменённых версии ПО, хотя производитель может это делать. Это абсолютно несовместимо с нашей целью - защитой пользовательских прав изменять ПО. Подобные злоупотребления систематически происходят в сфере продуктов индивидуального использования, в которой это особенно неприемлемо. Именно поэтому мы разработали данную версию GPL чтобы запретить подобную практику на этом рынке. Если подобные проблемы возникнут в других областях, мы, ради защиты свободы пользователей, готовы расширить действие лицензии на эти новые области в будущих версиях GPL.

Наконец, каждой программе постоянно угрожают софтверные патенты. Государства не должны допускать ограничение патентами разработки и использования ПО на компьютерах общего назначения, но т.к. они это делают, мы хотим избежать опасности наложения патентов на свободные программы, что сделает их, фактически, частной собственностью. Для предотвращения этого, GPL гарантирует, что патенты не могут быть использованы с целью сделать программу несвободной.

Ниже следуют точные условия копирования, распространения и изменения.

### УСЛОВИЯ

#### 0. Определения

"Данная Лицензия" подразумевает третью версию Стандартной Общественной Лицензии GNU.

"Авторское право" также обозначает законы, схожие с законами об авторском праве, применимые к другим видам произведений, например, топологиям интегральных микросхем.

"Программа" подразумевает любое охраноспособное произведение, лицензированное Данной Лицензией. К каждому владельцу лицензии (лицензиату) обращаются как "Вы". "Владельцы лицензии" и "получатели" могут быть как физическими, так и юридическими лицами.

"Модифицирование" произведения означает копирование или адаптация всего или части произведения в форме, требующей разрешения правообладателя и отличающееся от точного копирования. Результат называется "изменённой версией" предыдущего произведения или произведением, "основанным" на предыдущем произведении.

"Лицензированное произведение" подразумевает немодифицированную Программу, либо произведение, основанное на Программе.

"Тиражировать" произведение означает делать что-либо с ним, что, без разрешения, сделает вас непосредственно либо косвенно ответственным за нарушение авторского права в соответствии с применимым законом, за исключением запуска на компьютере или изменения личной копии. Тиражирование включает в себя копирование, распространение (с или без изменений), публикацию, и, в некоторых странах, некоторые другие действия.

"Передача" произведения означает любой вид тиражирования, который позволяет третьим лицам создавать или получать копии. Простое взаимодействие с пользователем через компьютерную сеть, без получения копии, передачей не является.

Пользовательский интерфейс отображает "Соответствующие правовые уведомления", которые включают, по крайней мере, легко доступные и заметные функции, которые (1) отображают соответствующее уведомление об авторском праве и (2) объясняют пользователю, что нет никакой гарантии на это произведение (кроме тех случаев, когда гарантии явно предоставлены), что владельцы лицензий могут передавать произведение согласно Данной Лицензии, и как посмотреть копию Данной Лицензии. Если интерфейс предоставляет набор пользовательских команд или меню, то соответствующий заметный пункт удовлетворяет данным условиям.

#### 1. Исходный код

"Исходный код" произведения подразумевает предпочитаемую форму произведения для создания его модификаций. "Объектный код" подразумевает любую другую форму произведения.

"Стандартный интерфейс" означает интерфейс, который либо является официальным стандартом, установленным признанным органом по стандартизации, либо, в случае интерфейсов, специфичных для конкретного языка программирования, тот, что широко распространён среди разработчиков на данном языке.

"Системные библиотеки" исполнимых произведений включают в себя всё отличное от произведения как целого, (а) включающееся в стандартную поставку Главного компонента, но не являющееся его частью, и (б) служащее только для использования других произведений с Главным Компонентом, либо для предоставления Стандартного Интерфейса, который доступен общественности в форме исходного кода. "Главный Компонент" в этом контексте означает главный существенный компонент (ядро, оконная система и т.д.) конкретной операционной системы (если присутствует) на которой выполняется произведение, либо компилятор, использованный для создания произведения, либо интерпретатор объектного кода, использованный для запуска произведения.

"Соответствующий Исходный Код" произведения в форме объектного кода подразумевает весь исходный код, необходимый для генерации, установки, выполнения(для выполнимых произведений) объектного кода и модификации произведения, включая скрипты, контролирующие эти действия. Однако, он не содержит Системные Библиотеки произведения, утилиты общего назначения или свободно доступные программы, которые использовались в немодифицированном виде для осуществления деятельности, но не являются частью произведения. Например, Соответствующий Исходный Код включает файлы определения интерфейса, связанные с файлами исходного кода произведения, и исходный код общих библиотек и динамически связанных подпрограмм, которые необходимы по идее автора произведения, таких как прямая передача данных или контрольный поток между этими подпрограммами и другими частями произведения.

Соответствующий Исходный Код не обязан включать в себя что-либо, что пользователь может автоматически сгенерировать из остальных частей Соответствующего Исходного Кода.

Соответствующий Исходный Код произведения в форме исходного кода - то же самое произведение.

#### 2. Основные свободы

Все права, предоставленные Данной Лицензией предоставляются на срок авторских прав на Программу и не могут быть отозваны при условии, что установленные условия соблюдены. Данная Лицензия однозначно подтверждает Ваши неограниченные права на запуск немодифицированной Программы. Действие Данной Лицензии на вывод произведения, защищённого Данной Лицензией, распространяется только в том случае, если вывод представляет собой лицензированное произведение. Данная Лицензия признаёт Ваши права на свободное использование или его эквивалент в соответствии с законом об авторском праве.

Вы можете создавать, запускать и тиражировать лицензированные произведения, которые Вы не передаёте, без условий, до тех пор, пока лицензия остаётся в силе. Вы можете передать лицензированное произведение третьим лицам с единственной целью - модификацией произведения исключительно для Вас, либо для предоставления Вам возможности запуска этих произведений, при условии что Вы выполняете условия Данной Лицензии при передаче материалов, на которые не обладаете авторским правом. Третьи лица, создающие или запускающие лицензированные произведения должны делать это исключительно от Вашего имени, под Вашим контролем, на условиях запрета создания копий материалов, защищённых авторским правом, без Вашего разрешения.

Передача при любых других обстоятельствах разрешена исключительно при условиях, установленных ниже. Сублицензирование запрещено; секция 10 исключает необходимость в этом.

#### 3. Защита Законных Прав Пользователей от Противотехнических Законов

Ни одно из лицензированных произведений не должно считаться частью технического средства защиты согласно любому применимому закону, выполняющему обязательства, наложенные статьёй 11 соглашения авторского права Всемирной Организации Интеллектуальной Собственности (WIPO), принятой 20 декабря 1996 года, или схожим законам, запрещающим или ограничивающим обход таких средств.

При передаче Вами лицензированного произведения, Вы отказываетесь от каких-либо юридических полномочий запрещать обход технических средств, пока такой обход находится в рамках осуществления прав, выданных Данной Лицензии, в знак уважения к лицензированному произведению, и Вы отказываетесь от любых намерений ограничить работу или модификацию произведения, как средств давления, направленных на пользователей произведения, Ваши законные права и права третьих лиц запретить обход технологических средств защиты.

#### 4. Передача Точных Копий

Вы можете передавать точные копии исходного кода Программы так же, как и получили, на любом носителе, при условии что в заметной и соответствующей форме публикуете уведомление об авторском праве на каждой копии; сохраняете нетронутыми все уведомления, устанавливающие что Данная Лицензия и любые неразрешающие условия, добавленные в соответствии с главой 7, применимы к тексту программы; сохраняете нетронутыми все уведомления об отсутствии гарантий; предоставляете всем получателям копию Данной Лицензии вместе с Программой.

Вы можете установить любую цену, либо не устанавливать цену, за каждую копию, которую Вы передаёте, также Вы можете предлагать поддержку или гарантии за плату.

#### 5. Передача Версий Модифицированного исходного кода

Вы можете передавать произведения, основанные на Программе, или модификации программы в форме исходного кода на условиях главы 4, также выполняя следующие условия:

a) Произведение должно содержать заметные уведомления, утверждающие что Вы изменили код, и содержащие действительную дату изменений.

б) Произведение должно содержать заметные уведомления, утверждающие что оно выпущена в соответствии с Данной Лицензией и любыми дополнительными условиями, установленными в соответствии с главой 7. Данное требование изменяет требование секции 4 "оставлять нетронутыми все уведомления".

в) Вы должны выдать лицензии на произведение, как единое целое, в соответствии с Данной Лицензией, всем, кто захочет получить копию. Данная Лицензия распространяться со всеми применимыми условиями главы 7, на всё произведение, и каждую его часть, безотносительно того, как они поставляются. Данная Лицензия не допускает выдачи лицензий на произведение другими способами, но не запрещает этого, если Вы получили разрешение на выдачу лицензий отдельно.

г) Если в произведении присутствуют пользовательские интерфейсы, каждый должен отображать "Соответствующие Правовые Уведомления"; если же Программа имеет пользовательские интерфейсы, которые не отображают "Соответствующие Правовые Уведомления", Ваше произведение должно это исправить.

Компиляция лицензированного произведения с другими отдельными и независимыми произведениями, которые по своей природе не являются расширениями лицензированного произведения и не соединены с ним с целью сформировать большую программу, на носителе хранения или распространения, называется "агрегацией", если компиляция и её суммарные авторские права не ограничивают доступ и юридические права пользователя компиляции относительно исходного произведения. Включение лицензированного произведения в агрегацию не распространяет действие Данной Лицензии на остальные части агрегации.

#### 6. Передача не-исходных форм

Вы можете передавать лицензированные произведения в форме объектного кода на условиях глав 4 и 5, в том случае если Вы также передаёте машиночитаемый Соответствующий Исходный Код на условиях Данной Лицензии, одним из следующих путей:

а) Передаёте объектный код в (или встроенным в) физическом продукте (включая физический дистрибутивный носитель) вместе с Соответствующим Исходным Кодом, расположенным на физическом носителе, широко используемом для обмена ПО.

б) Передаёте объектный код в (или встроенным в) физическом продукте (включая физический дистрибутивный носитель) вместе с письменным обещанием, действительным по меньшей мере в течение трёх лет и до тех пор, пока Вы предоставляете запасные части или поддержку для данной модели продукта, предоставить любому обладателю объектного кода либо (1) копию Соответствующего Исходного Кода для всего ПО продукта, лицензированного Данной Лицензией, на физическом носителе, широко используемом для обмена ПО, по цене, не превышающей физические затраты на передачу исходного кода, либо (2) возможность скопировать Соответствующий Исходный Код с сетевого сервера без взимания платы.

в) Передаёте персональные копии объектного кода с копией письменного обещания предоставить Соответствующий Исходный Код. Данный способ разрешён только в редких случаях и на некоммерческой основе, только если Вы получили объектный код в такой форме, в соответствии с пунктом 6б.

г) Передаёте объектный код, предоставляя доступ из обозначенного места (бесплатно, либо за определённую плату) и предоставляете аналогичный доступ к Соответствующему Исходному Коду тем же путём, из того же места, без последующей оплаты. Нет необходимости предоставлять Соответствующий Исходный Код в комплекте с объектным кодом. Если местом доступа является сетевой сервер, Соответствующий Исходный Код может находиться на другом сервере (обслуживаемом Вами, либо третьими лицами), предоставляющем аналогичные возможности копирования; объектный код должен сопровождаться ясными указаниями местоположения Соответствующего Исходного Кода. Независимо от того, на каком сервере расположен Соответствующий Исходный Код, Вы обязаны убедиться в том, что он доступен столько, сколько необходимо для соответствия данным требованиям.

д) Передаёте объектный код, используя передачу от пользователя к пользователю (peer-to-peer), сообщая пользователям где объектный код и Соответствующий Исходный Код общедоступен без взимания платы согласно пункту 6г.

Нет необходимости включать в передачу произведения в форме объектного кода отделимые части объектного кода, чей исходный код исключён из Соответствующего Исходного Кода как Системная Библиотека.

"Пользовательский Продукт" это либо (1) "потребительский товар", подразумевающий любые формы материального личного имущества, которые используются для личных, семейных или домовладельческих целей, либо (2) что-либо спроектированное или продающееся для установки дома. При определении является ли продукт потребительским товаром, случаи, вызывающие сомнения, будут решены в пользу лицензирования. Для конкретного продукта, полученного конкретным пользователем, "обычное использование" подразумевает типичное или распространённое использование такого типа продуктов, безотносительно статуса конкретного пользователя или того, как конкретный пользователь использует, или рассчитывает, или будет использовать продукт. Продукт является потребительским товаром безотносительно того, имеет ли он существенные коммерческие, промышленные или непотребительские применения до тех пор, пока такие применения не являются единственными существенными применениями продукта.

"Установочная Информация" Пользовательского Продукта подразумевает методы, процедуры, ключи доступа и другую информацию, необходимую для установки и запуска модифицированных версий лицензированного произведения в Пользовательском Продукте из модифицированной версий Соответствующего Исходного Кода. Информация должна быть достаточна для гарантирования того, что стандартный функционал изменённого объектного кода ни в каком случае не ограничивается или искажается из-за произведённых изменений.

Если Вы передаёте объектный код согласно данной главе б, или в, или исключительно для использования в Пользовательском Продукте, и передача происходит как часть сделки, в которой права владения и использования Пользовательского Продукта переходят получателю пожизненно либо на определённый срок (безотносительно того, как характеризована сделка), Соответствующий Исходный Код, передаваемый согласно данной главе должен быть сопровождён Установочной Информацией. Данное требование не действует если ни Вы, ни третьи лица не имеете возможности установить модифицированный объектный код на Пользовательский Продукт (например, произведение установлено в ROM).

Требование предоставления Установочной Информации не включает требование предоставления поддержки, гарантии или обновлений на произведения, которое было модифицировано либо установлено получателем, или для Пользовательского Продукта, в котором произведение модифицировано или установлено. Доступ к сети может быть запрещён, если сама модификация существенно и негативно действует на работу сети, либо нарушает правила и протоколы передачи данных в сети.

Предоставленные Соответствующий Исходный Код и Установочная Информация в соответствии с данной главой должны быть в открыто-документированном формате(имеющем реализацию, доступную в форме исходного кода), и не должны запрашивать пароля либо ключа для распаковки, чтения или копирования.

#### 7. Дополнительные свободы

"Дополнительные свободы" - это условия, которые дополняют Данную Лицензию путём создания исключений из одного или нескольких условий. Дополнительные свободы, применимые ко всей Программе, должны быть расценены как если бы они были включены в Данную Лицензию, в случае если они действительны согласно применимому закону. Если дополнительные свободы применяются только к части Программы, эта часть может быть использована отдельно на этих условиях, но вся Программа остаётся под действием Данной лицензии без учёта дополнительных условий.

Когда Вы передаёте копию лицензированного произведения, Вы имеете право убрать любые дополнительные свободы из этой копии, либо из любой её части. (Дополнительные свободы могут требовать их удаления в конкретных случаях когда Вы модифицируете произведение.) Вы можете добавить дополнительные свободы к материалам, добавленным Вами в лицензированное произведение и на которые Вы имеете или можете предоставить разрешение правообладателя.

Несмотря на любые другие положения Данной Лицензии, на материал, добавленный Вами к лицензированному произведению, Вы можете (если разрешено держателями авторских прав на материал) дополнить условия Данной Лицензии следующими условиями:

а) Отказ от гарантий или ограничения ответственности иначе, чем установлено в главах 15 и 16 данной лицензии; либо

б) Требование сохранения определённых действительных юридических уведомлений или авторства в материале, или в Соответствующих Правовых Уведомлениях, отображаемых произведением, их содержащим; либо

в) Запрет на искажение оригинального материала, либо требование к модифицированным версиям такого материала содержать пометку в надлежащей форме о том, что материал отличается от оригинальной версии; либо

г) Ограничение на использование, в целях публикации, имён лицензоров либо авторов материала; либо

д) Отказ предоставлять права согласно закону о торговых марках на использование некоторых торговых имён, торговых марок, сервисных марок; либо

е) Требование компенсации лицензорам и авторам материала кем либо, кто передаёт материал (или модифицированные версии материала) с договорным принятием ответственности получателем, для любой ответственности, которую данное договорное принятие непосредственно налагает на правообладателей и авторов.

Все остальные не-разрешающие дополнительные условия считаются "дополнительными запретами", что попадает под действие главы 10. Если Программа в том виде, в котором Вы её получили, либо её часть, содержит уведомление, устанавливающее, что она защищена Данной Лицензией и при этом содержит дополнительные запреты, Вы можете удалить данные запреты. Если документ лицензии содержит дополнительные запреты, но допускает релицензирование или передачу на условиях Данной Лицензии, Вы можете добавить к лицензированному произведению материал, защищённый условиями того лицензионного документа, при условии что дополнительный запрет не сохраняется при таком релицензировании или передаче.

Если Вы добавляете условия в лицензированное произведение в соответствии с данной главой, Вы должны добавить в затронутые исходные файлы, утверждение о том, что дополнительные условия применяются к этим файлам, а также уведомление о том где искать данные условия.

Дополнительные условия, разрешающие либо неразрешающие, могут быть установлены в форме отдельной лицензии, либо установлены как исключения; требования, перечисленные Выше применяются в любом случае.

#### 8. Окончание действия

Вы не можете тиражировать или изменять лицензированное произведение, за исключением тех случаев когда это в прямой форме изложено в условиях Данной Лицензии. Любая попытка тиражирования или модификации произведения на иных условиях недействительна и автоматически снимает с Вас все права выданные Данной Лицензией (включая любые патенты, предоставленные лицензией согласно третьему параграфу главы 11).

Однако, в том случае, когда Вы прекращаете нарушение Данной Лицензии, лицензия от конкретного правообладателя восстанавливается (а) временно, до тех пор пока правообладатель явно и окончательно не окончит действие Вашей лицензии, и (б) на постоянной основе, если правообладателю не удастся уведомить Вас о нарушении с помощью надлежащих средств в срок 60 дней с момента прекращения нарушений.

Кроме того, Ваша лицензия от конкретного правообладателя восстанавливается на постоянной основе в случае если правообладатель уведомляет Вас о нарушении с помощью надлежащих средств, но Вы впервые получаете уведомление о нарушении Данной Лицензии (для любого произведения) от этого правообладателя и устраняете нарушение в течение 30 дней после получения уведомления.

Лишение Вас прав согласно данной секции не лишает прав людей, которые получили от Вас копии или права согласно Данной Лицензией. Если Ваши права приостановлены и не восстановлены на постоянной основе, Вы не можете получить новую лицензию на тот же материал согласно главе 10.

#### 9. Соглашение не требуется для копирования

Вы не обязаны принимать Данную Лицензию чтобы получить или запустить копию Программы. В дополнении, тиражирование лицензированного произведения, происходящее исключительно как совокупность передач от пользователя к пользователю, требуемых для получения копии также не требует соглашения. Однако, только Данная Лицензия даёт Вам права тиражирования или изменения любых лицензированных произведений. Такие действия нарушают авторское право, если Вы не приняли Данную Лицензию. Поэтому изменяя или тиражируя лицензированное произведение, Вы подтверждаете своё согласие с Данной Лицензией.

#### 10. Автоматическое Лицензирование Последующих Получателей

Каждый раз, когда Вы передаёте лицензированное произведение, получатель автоматически получает лицензию от первоначального лицензора на запуск, изменение и тиражирование произведения, подчинённого Данной Лицензии. Вы не ответственны за соблюдение Данной Лицензии третьими лицами.

"Юридическая сделка" - сделка передающая контроль организации, или практически все активы таковой, или разделение организации, или слияние организаций. Если тиражирование лицензированного произведения является результатом юридической сделки, каждая сторона сделки, получающая копию произведения также получает все лицензии на произведение, которые предшественник стороны имел или мог выдать согласно предыдущему параграфу, плюс право владения Соответствующим Исходным Кодом произведения от предшественника, если он обладал Соответствующим Исходным Кодом, либо мог получить его при соответствующем запросе.

Вы не можете налагать никакие дополнительные запреты на осуществление прав выданных или подтверждённых согласно Данной Лицензии. Например, Вы не можете налагать лицензионные сборы, авторский гонорар, или другие виды выплат за осуществление прав, выданных согласно Данной Лицензии, и Вы не можете инициировать судебный процесс (включая встречный иск), заявляя что любое патентное требование нарушено путём создания, использования, продажи, предложения продажи или импортирования Программы либо любой её части.

#### 11. Патенты

"Вкладчик" – правообладатель, разрешающий использование согласно Данной Лицензии Программы либо произведения, на котором основана Программа. Произведение, лицензированное таким образом, называется "версией вкладчика".

"Основные патентные требования" вкладчика - все патентные требования которые имеет или контролирует вкладчик, либо уже приобретённые, либо намеченные для приобретения, которые будут нарушены тем или иным образом, допускающимся Данной Лицензией, включая создание, использование или продажа версии вкладчика, но исключая требования, которые будут нарушены только в форме совокупности будущих изменений версии вкладчика. В рамках данного определения, "контроль" включает в себя право выдавать патентные сублицензии в форме, следующей требованиям Данной Лицензии.

Каждый вкладчик выдаёт Вам неэксклюзивные, международные, свободные от отчислений патентные лицензии, согласно основным патентным требованиям вкладчика, на использование, продажу, предложение продажи, импортирование и запуск, изменение и тиражирование содержимого версии вкладчика.

В следующих трёх параграфах, "патентная лицензия" - любое выражение соглашения или обязательства не применять патент(например, выдача прав на использование патентованного произведения или обязательство не подавать исков за нарушение патента). "Выдать" такую патентную лицензию одной из сторон означает заключить такое соглашение или обязательство не применять патент против этой стороны.

Если Вы передаёте лицензированное произведение, сознательно основываясь на патентной лицензии и при этом Соответствующий Исходный Код произведения не доступен никому для копирования бесплатно и в соответствии с условиями Данной Лицензии через общедоступный сервер или другими легкодоступными методами, Вы должны либо (1) сделать так чтобы Соответствующий Исходный Код был доступен, либо (2) лишить себя патентной лицензии на данное конкретное произведение, либо (3) оговорить, соответствующим Данной Лицензии образом, расширение патентной лицензии для последующих получателей. "Сознательно основываясь" означает что Вы знаете условия патентной лицензии, но передача лицензированного произведения в стране, либо использование лицензированного произведения получателями в стране, нарушит один или более патент, который можно идентифицировать, в этой стране и который Вы имеете основания считать действительным.

Если в соответствии с или в связи с конкретной сделкой или соглашением Вы передаёте, тиражируете, путём наладки передачи, лицензированное произведение и предоставляете одной из сторон патентную лицензию после получения лицензированного произведения, давая им право использовать, тиражировать, модифицировать или передавать конкретную копию лицензионного произведения, в этом случае патентная лицензия, которую Вы предоставляете автоматически расширяет своё действие на всех получателей лицензированного произведения основанного на ней.

Патентная лицензия является "дискриминационной", если она не описывает свою сферу применения, запрещает осуществление или обусловлена неосуществлением одного или более прав, которые явно выдаются согласно Данной Лицензии. Вы не можете передавать лицензированное произведение если Вы - одна из сторон соглашения с третьей стороной, которая занимается дистрибуцией ПО, согласно которой Вы производите выплату третьему лицу в зависимости от объёма осуществляемых передач, и согласно которой третье лицо выдаёт, любой стороне, получающей лицензированное произведение от Вас, дискриминационную патентную лицензию (а) вместе с копиями лицензированного произведения, переданными Вами (или копиями, сделанными с этих копий), или (б) вместе с конкретными продуктами или сборками, содержащими лицензированное произведение, в случае если Вы не вступили в соглашение или патентная лицензия не предоставлена до 28 марта 2007г.

Ничто в Данной Лицензии не должно быть рассмотрено как исключение или ограничение любой подразумеваемой лицензии или других способов противодействия нарушению, которые в других случаях могут быть доступны для Вас согласно применимому патентному закону.

#### 12. Не отказывать свободе других

Условия, наложенные на Вас (судебным приказом, соглашением или как-либо ещё), которые противоречат условиям Данной лицензии, не освобождают Вас от условий, наложенных Данной Лицензией. Если Вы не можете передавать лицензированное произведение так, чтобы удовлетворять одновременно Вашим обязательствам согласно Данной Лицензии и любым другим релевантным обязательствам, то Вы можете не распространять её вовсе. Например, если Вы согласны с условиями, обязывающими Вас собирать авторские отчисления с тех, кому Вы передаёте Программу, за право последующей передачи, единственный способ удовлетворить этим условиям и Данной Лицензии будет полное воздержание от передачи Программы.

#### 13. Использование совместно со Стандартной Общественной Лицензией редакции Афферо

Несмотря на любые другие положения настоящей Лицензии, Вы имеете разрешение подключать или совмещать любое лицензированное произведение с произведением, лицензированным согласно версии 3 Стандартной Общественной Лицензии редакции Афферо (Affero) в единое комбинированное произведение и передавать его. Условия Данной Лицензии продолжат применяться к той части произведения, которая изначально находилась под ней, но специальные требования главы 13 редакции Афферо, касающиеся взаимодействия через компьютерную сеть, будут применяться ко всему объединённому произведению.

#### 14. Пересмотренные Версии Данной Лицензии

Фонд Свободного Программного Обеспечения может публиковать пересмотренные и/или новые версии Стандартной Общественной Лицензии GNU время от времени. Такие пересмотренные версии будут схожи по духу нынешней версии, но могут отличаться в деталях, чтобы соответствовать новым проблемам.

Каждой версии выдаётся отличительный номер. Если Программа устанавливает, что конкретный номер версии GNU GPL "или любая более поздняя версия" применима к ней, Вы можете следовать условиям либо версии указанного номера, либо более поздних версий, опубликованных Фондом Свободного Программного Обеспечения. Если программа не указывает номер версии GNU GPL, Вы можете выбрать любую версию, когда либо опубликованную Фондом.

Если программа уточняет, что уполномоченный представитель может решать какая из будущих версий GNU GPL может быть использована, публичное заявление этого представителя о принятии версии на постоянной основе даёт Вам право выбрать эту версию для Программы.

Следующие версии лицензии могут давать Вам дополнительные или другие разрешения. Несмотря на это, дополнительные обязательства не возлагаются на автора или правообладателя как результат Вашего выбора следующих версий.

#### 15. Отказ от гарантий

НА ПРОГРАММУ НЕ РАСПРОСТРАНЯЮТСЯ НИКАКИЕ ГАРАНТИИ ДО РАМОК, ДОПУСТИМЫХ ПРИМЕНИМЫМ ЗАКОНОМ. ЕСЛИ ИНОЕ НЕ УСТАНОВЛЕНО В ПИСЬМЕННОЙ ФОРМЕ, ПРАВООБЛАДАТЕЛЬ И/ИЛИ ДРУГИЕ СТОРОНЫ ПРЕДОСТАВЛЯЮТ ПРОГРАММУ «КАК ЕСТЬ», БЕЗ КАКИХ ЛИБО ГАРАНТИЙ (ЗАЯВЛЕННЫХ ИЛИ ПОДРАЗУМЕВАЕМЫХ), ВКЛЮЧАЯ, НО НЕ ОГРАНИЧИВАЯСЬ, ПОДРАЗУМЕВАЕМЫМИ ГАРАНТИЯМИ ТОВАРНОГО СОСТОЯНИЯ ПРИ ПРОДАЖЕ И ГОДНОСТИ ДЛЯ ОПРЕДЕЛЁННОГО ПРИМЕНЕНИЯ. ВЕСЬ РИСК КАК В ОТНОШЕНИИ КАЧЕСТВА, ТАК И ПРОИЗВОДИТЕЛЬНОСТИ ПРОГРАММЫ ВЫ БЕРЁТЕ НА СЕБЯ. ЕСЛИ В ПРОГРАММЕ ОБНАРУЖЕН ДЕФЕКТ, ВЫ БЕРЁТЕ НА СЕБЯ СТОИМОСТЬ НЕОБХОДИМОГО ОБСЛУЖИВАНИЯ, ПОЧИНКИ ИЛИ ИСПРАВЛЕНИЯ.

#### 16. Ограничение ответственности

НИ В КОЕМ СЛУЧАЕ, ЕСЛИ НЕ ТРЕБУЕТСЯ ПРИМЕНИМЫМ ЗАКОНОМ ИЛИ ПИСЬМЕННЫМ СОГЛАШЕНИЕМ, НИ ОДИН ИЗ ПРАВООБЛАДАТЕЛЕЙ ИЛИ СТОРОН, ИЗМЕНЯВШИХ И/ИЛИ ПЕРЕДАВАВШИХ ПРОГРАММУ, КАК БЫЛО РАЗРЕШЕНО ВЫШЕ, НЕ ОТВЕТСТВЕНЕН ЗА УЩЕРБ, ВКЛЮЧАЯ ОБЩИЙ, КОНКРЕТНЫЙ, СЛУЧАЙНЫЙ ИЛИ ПОСЛЕДОВАВШИЙ УЩЕРБ, ВЫТЕКАЮЩИЙ ИЗ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЯ ИЛИ НЕВОЗМОЖНОСТИ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЯ ПРОГРАММЫ (ВКЛЮЧАЯ, НО НЕ ОГРАНИЧИВАЯСЬ ПОТЕРЕЙ ДАННЫХ ИЛИ НЕВЕРНОЙ ОБРАБОТКОЙ ДАННЫХ, ИЛИ ПОТЕРИ, УСТАНОВЛЕННЫЕ ВАМИ ИЛИ ТРЕТЬИМИ ЛИЦАМИ, ИЛИ НЕВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ПРОГРАММЫ РАБОТАТЬ С ДРУГИМИ ПРОГРАММАМИ), ДАЖЕ В СЛУЧАЕ ЕСЛИ ПРАВООБЛАДАТЕЛЬ ЛИБО ДРУГАЯ СТОРОНА БЫЛА ИЗВЕЩЕНА О ВОЗМОЖНОСТИ ТАКОГО УЩЕРБА.

#### 17. Интерпретация глав 15 и 16

Если отказ от гарантии или ограничение ответственности представленные выше не могут быть исполнены согласно их условиям, рассматривающие суды должны применить местный закон, который наиболее приближен к абсолютному отказу от всей гражданской ответственности в связи с Программой, исключая случаи когда гарантия или принятие ответственности сопровождают копию Программы за плату.
